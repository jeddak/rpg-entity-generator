  template_name: Tiger
  Description: "With the exception of smilodon, tigers are the largest of the big
cats. Highly territorial and generally solitary (save for females with
cubs) they frequent many different climates including arctic envi-
ronments. Their natural camouflage, usually with the characteris-
tic black stripes, means they can move with high stealth, increasing
their ambush capabilities. The pattern of stripes is unique to each
tiger, and helps the animals to conceal themselves amongst the shadows, foliage and long grass as they stalk their prey.\n\
The chief means of attack is the powerful bite, followed by claw
rakes. A hungry tiger is tenacious and will stalk prey for a great distance if driven by an empty stomach. They are undeterred by prey
larger themselves although these cats are still cautious given that -
generally - they do not hunt in large numbers, and have little in the
way of support.
