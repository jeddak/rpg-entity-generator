  template_name: Smilodon
  Description: "Often known as sabre-toothed tigers, although
this is a misnomer, these big cats are noted for
both their intimidating physical size and pronounced canine fangs which arch
down well below the lower jaw
and average around 30 centimetres in length. Smilodon are
incredibly robust and strong
when compared with other
big cats – especially in their
forequarters.
  \n\
Built for power rather
than speed, they are ambush
hunters, using height to leap
down on their prey, combining the delivery of a stabbing
downward thrust with their
incisors together with the
impact of their sheer bulk
to overwhelm their victims.
Death is usually delivered by crushing the windpipe, a task made easier if the prey has
been surprised, stabbed and then crushed under smilodon’s
weight.  \n\
Smilodon hunt in small family packs of
between three and eight animals, although
lone smilodon are also known. Their powerful forelimbs mean they are excellent
climbers, and so they make use of any
naturally high terrain to ambush their
prey.
