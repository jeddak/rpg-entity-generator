  template_name: Lion
  Description: "Savannah and plains-dwelling big cats, lions form prides of
between 10 and 20 (around five females and cubs, and two or three
males). Males excluded from a pride can, and do, become rogue
wanderers, and so lions can also be encountered singly. The females
perform most of the hunting with the males guarding the pride’s
territory from other prides and interlopers.
Hunting is a co-ordinated business with three or more lionesses
stalking and chasing-down prey over a protracted period. Such
teamwork increases the success of the hunt. Each lioness in a hunt-
ing party has a preferred role, with a leader and stalkers who trian-
gulate to reduce the chance of prey escaping.
It is rare for lions to prey on humans but not unheard of. Settle-
ments with livestock populations that are established too close to a
pride’s territories increases the chance of attacks, and rogue males
(particularly the sick or injured), driven by hunger, will look for what-
ever prey is available."
